        <h2>Narendra Modi ji</h2>&nbsp;
        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Narendra Modi first assumed an elected office on October 7, 2001. On May 26, 2022, he completed 20 years in that position. Over the two decades, the “idea of Modi” spread and held sway over a country of a billion-plus people with a fascinating diversity of cultures, languages and geographies. In many ways, it is the “idea of Modi” that has served as the unifying force redefining India. In 2014, Prime Minister (PM) Modi set the ball rolling on that project when he presented an all-inclusive, growth oriented “idea of India”. An “idea of India” that sets an ideological framework of equality and growth, steering clear of doles, privileges and sectoral giveaways.</p>
        <p>Over the last 20 years, his popularity has only soared in the eyes of the people. He has been topping global leadership popularity charts with amazing consistency. And that perhaps has been the most remarkable aspect of his journey as a leader of the masses. History tells us elected leaders, over the course of time, see their popularity and charisma wane. They make mistakes, they tire out, they take their mandates for granted, they start to treat power as an end unto itself. But not PM Modi. He has used his positions, as three-time Gujarat chief minister and India’s PM, as nothing more than an opportunity to serve Bharat.

          As this momentous journey dedicated to the service of India and its people completes 20 years, it is pertinent to understand what “Modi magic” is and what makes it work. It is also important to understand how PM Modi is giving shape to his “idea of India”. The one book that currently holds the answer to that question is Modi@20: Dreams Meet Delivery, an anthology put together by people of eminence and achievements, with the book’s foreword having been written by the late Lata Mangeshkar.<p>
          <p> Indian badminton’s pride PV Sindhu sets the tone in the very first chapter, Why Modi is the Undisputed Youth Icon, in explaining “Modi magic” by highlighting through personal anecdotes how the PM has brought about an attitudinal shift from kaise hoga (how will it be done) to hoga kaise nahi (how can it not get done). People who have worked with the PM can vouch for the truth in Sindhu’s observation. He has never seen a problem as a problem but an opportunity to optimise the latent potential in the country for the best results.</p>
